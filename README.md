### Preface
First of all, I want put forth claim that in my own life, having technical prowess **has helped me** find creative solutions to specific problems.
Examples:

I believe that being the forfront of seeing users struggle (e.g. not utilizing technology to the fullest), puts tech support in an **advantegous position** to demonstrate their value and provide solutions. A lot of these guys play with software products for fun (I know I did), and will spend hours on Product Hunt or . trying to find the best. Wouldn't it be nice if John from Accounting wanted to find a better way to organize his ? You can give a unique/customizable solution of using (which no book/school) and John will be happy. (of course, there's always considerations like security...in which case Security officer can be contacted). So by having this fusion of intution (for ) I believe the veloctiy peopls workflow will improve (and systems fine-tunin), via better suggestons by Tech Support.

### Exper
Working in IT support over a year (in 2 seperate institutions), it's always perplexed me why there's there's divide between the **IT Department** and **Business Employees**. More specificically, I neverknw why past supervisors never bother to ask me to do the following during my free-time:

2. **Draw up User Stories**: And plan support around them, in the hopes that having that  knowledge *plus* our expertise will provide serendiptious solutions to our user's technical woes.
3. **Test out different software**: on my own computer. Using **VMs**, **Sandboxes**, and **dummy data**. Acting as if I was a the user, for whom I'm supporting.

Instead, they said "Do what you want".

**Unless your are backend**, if your work involves having direct contact with customers (e.g UI/UX, ) it's important to have empathy and know the struggles and use cases of your users.

IT Support can be viewed **Supplmental Work**...or work that, by itself, yields no purposes....While there are some abosolutes a company needs (e.g. having Active Directory, ..), and IT Support is plugging up those holes left behind bad by software and their implmentations (a very reactive approach), there's very little known in IT Deparments on the **context** of the type of work done on those systems. Those very users who.
