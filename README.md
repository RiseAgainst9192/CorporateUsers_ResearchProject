### Motive
First I will say the biggest motivator to embarking this my knowledge in technology **has helped me** find creative solutions to everyday problems
Examples:

Working in IT support over a year (in 2 seperate institutions), it's always perplexed me why there's there's divide between the **IT Department** and **Business Employees**. More specificically, I neverknw why past supervisors never bother to ask me to do the following during my free-time:

1. **Talk to users**. Asked them they how they worked or what their common job duties were.
2. **Draw up User Stories**: And plan support around them, in the hopes that having that  knowledge *plus* our expertise will provide serendiptious solutions to our user's technical woes.
3. **Test out different software**: on my own computer. Using **VMs**, **Sandboxes**, and **dummy data**. Acting as if I was a the user, for whom I'm supporting.

Instead, they said "Do what you want".

**Unless your are backend**, if your work involves having direct contact with customers (e.g UI/UX, ) it's important to have empathy and know the struggles and use cases of your users.

IT Support can be viewed **Supplmental Work**...or work that, by itself, yields no purposes....While there are some abosolutes a company needs (e.g. having Active Directory, ..), and IT Support is plugging up those holes left behind bad by software and their implmentations (a very reactive approach), there's very little known in IT Deparments on the **context** of the type of work done on those systems. Those very users who.
